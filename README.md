Lightweight Attention System

Welcome! This repository showcases a lightweight transformer system featuring a lightweight multi-head attention mechanism.

What is Light Attention?

Light Attention is an optimized variation of multi-head attention designed for environments with limited resources (like mobile devices). It introduces a temperature system to determine the quality of embeddings processed by the attention mechanism.

This lightweight design was born out of necessity—transformers can be computationally heavy, and my phone simply couldn't handle them. While still a prototype, Light Attention offers flexibility and potential for customization.

Key Features

Lightweight: Optimized to run on devices with constrained resources.

Customizable: You can integrate Light Attention into encoders, decoders, or other hierarchical systems.

Temperature-Based Control: Uses a temperature parameter to smooth and adjust the scaling of attention outputs.

Softmax Importance System: Enhances attention calculations with weighted embedding importance.


Why Create This?

The goal is to enable efficient transformer-like performance without the high computational cost. This system is perfect for experimentation, especially if you're working with resource-limited hardware.

How Can You Help?

Feel free to:

Modify the attention mechanism to fit your needs.

Experiment with integrating it into different systems.

Final Thoughts

This is an early prototype, and the mathematical foundations might still need refinement. However, I hope you find it interesting and useful for your projects. Let’s collaborate and improve this lightweight attention system together!
